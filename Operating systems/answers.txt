Answers to exercises G1--G3:

G1.) Informally, we are searching for all the files that carry the expression "void".
First few lines:
sthread.cpp:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex)
sthread.cpp:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex)
sthread.cpp:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex)
sthread.cpp:void smutex_unlock(smutex_t *mutex)
sthread.cpp:void scond_signal(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex __attribute__((unused)))
sthread.cpp:void scond_broadcast(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex __attribute__((unused)))
sthread.cpp:void scond_wait(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex)
grep: build/estoresim: binary file matches
grep: build/sthread.o: binary file matches
sthread.h:typedef pthread_mutex_t smutex_t;
sthread.h:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex);

G2.) To search the file RequestGenerator.cpp for Tast objects would be
grep "Task" RequestGenerator.cpp

To search all header files for the keyword "return"

grep "return" *.h

G3.) When I ran that command I noticed that the all the lines returned had "void smutex" along with a different variation of either lock or unlock. This tells me that we are looking at all the files which contain mutexes or more specifically the "smutex" type.
